# Small vue project for a job interview
In this small app using vue and typescript, the user can rate whether or not they like the cat they see.
The cat pictures are fetched from https://thecatapi.com

## Technologies used
* Vuejs using the options api
* Typescript
  * Not the best idea, as I was still learning vuejs and ended up using a lot of "any" in this project. Didn't focus on learning how to use TS with vue.
* Vuex for state management
* Vue router

## Get started
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
